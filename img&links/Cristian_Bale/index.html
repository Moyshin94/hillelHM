        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Wales to English parents, Bale had his breakthrough role at
          age 13 in Steven Spielberg's 1987 war film Empire of the Sun. After
          more than a decade of performing in leading and supporting roles in
          films, he gained wider recognition for his portrayals of serial killer
          Patrick Bateman in the black comedy American Psycho (2000) and the
          titular role in the psychological thriller The Machinist (2004). In
          2005, he played superhero Batman in Batman Begins and again in The
          Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), garnering acclaim
          for his performance in the trilogy, which is one of the
          highest-grossing film franchises. Bale continued in starring roles in
          a range of films outside his work as Batman, including the period
          drama The Prestige (2006), the action film Terminator Salvation
          (2009), the crime drama Public Enemies (2009), the epic film Exodus:
          Gods and Kings (2014) and the superhero film Thor: Love and Thunder
          (2022). For his portrayal of boxer Dicky Eklund in the 2010
          biographical film The Fighter, he won an Academy Award and a Golden
          Globe Award. Further Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations
          came for his work in the black comedy American Hustle (2013) and the
          biographical dramedies The Big Short (2015) and Vice (2018). His
          performances as politician Dick Cheney in Vice and race car driver Ken
          Miles in the sports drama Ford v Ferrari (2019) earned him a second
          win and a fifth nomination respectively at the Golden Globe Awards.

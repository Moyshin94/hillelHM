      <h1>The Current War</h1>
      <h2>film about founders of electricity</h2>
      <p>Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse -- the greatest inventors of the industrial age -- engage in a battle of
        technology and ideas that will determine whose electrical system will power the new century. Backed by J.P.
        Morgan, Edison dazzles the world by lighting Manhattan. But Westinghouse, aided by Nikola Tesla, sees fatal
        flaws in Edison's direct current design. Westinghouse and Tesla bet everything on risky and dangerous
        alternating current.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>James Mangold's "3:10 to Yuma" restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of
        pointless violence. The Western in its glory days was often a morality play, a story about humanist values
        penetrating the lawless anarchy of the frontier. It still follows that tradition in films like Eastwood's
        "Unforgiven," but the audience's appetite for morality plays and Westerns seems to be fading. Here the quality
        of the acting, and the thought behind the film, make it seem like a vanguard of something new, even though it's
        a remake of a good movie 50 years old.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>The Big Short (2015) is an American financial drama film based on the famous book “The Big Short: Inside the
        Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis” portraying how few financial industry professionals predicted the buildup of
        the real estate bubble before the crisis of 2008. It shows how professionals working at large hedge funds and
        investment banks made fortunes after the collapse of the housing bubble. The movie gives a very good insight
        into the functioning of the biggest investment banks and events that led to a huge financial crisis in 2008
        affecting the entire world economy and leaving millions of people homeless.</p>
